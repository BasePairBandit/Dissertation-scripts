7 scripts I used in my MSc research project

#LIMMA Script
The LIMMA script performs differential expression analysis on gene expression data, using phenotype variables to identify significant genes and visualize the results. Initially, it reads expression and phenotype data from CSV files, ensuring that only samples with complete phenotype data are included. It aligns the expression data with the phenotype data based on sample IDs. A design matrix is created for linear modelling, incorporating the primary phenotype of interest and covariates such as age and BMI. Using the limma package, the script fits linear models to the data, applies contrasts, and performs empirical bayes moderation to refine the variance estimates. It generates a topTable containing p-values, log-fold changes, and other statistics, which are saved to a CSV file. Significant genes are filtered based on adjusted p-values and saved separately. An MA plot is produced to visualize the overall distribution of log-fold changes versus average expression. The script then creates a volcano plot with ggplot2, highlighting significant genes and annotating the top 100 most significant ones. 
Overall, the script integrates statistical analysis with visualizations to comprehensively assess and present differential gene expression results.
The full LIMMA script used for the analysis is provided in appendix I. A summary of the main features of the script are listed below.

#Fisher's Exact Test script
The Fisher’s test script is designed to perform a Fisher’s Exact Test for associations between gene lists by comparing pairs of lists. The function “perform_fishers_test” creates a contingency table for each pair and then calculates the p-value using Fisher’s Exact Test. For each pair, Fisher’s Exact Test will return a p-value: if the p-value is below 0.05, it suggests a statistically significant association while a p-value above the threshold indicates no significant association, implying any overlap could be due to random chance, therefore retaining the null hypothesis of independence. 

#Cluster profilr script
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is crucial for interpreting high-throughput omics data and identifying dysregulated biological processes in specific conditions or diseases. However, a redundancy problem arises due to the overlap of genes across multiple pathways, leading to highly correlated and redundant pathways. This results in an overwhelming number of significant pathways, complicating the interpretation of GSEA results. To address this, it is necessary to aggregate similar pathways and analyse their interactions to simplify and enhance the interpretation of the data. 
Clusterprofiler is an R package which helps in interpreting GSEA results 66. The Clusterprofiler package employs various metrics to assess similarities between pathway gene sets, identifies clusters of related pathways, and assigns meaningful biological names to these clusters. Additionally, it creates an interactive visual representation of an enrichment network, allowing users to explore and clarify the biological processes influenced by experimental conditions. 
The four gene lists are processed using the Clusterprofiler script to identify and help visualize the enrichment networks effectively. This allows the verification of overlap of enrichment networks between the four gene lists.
